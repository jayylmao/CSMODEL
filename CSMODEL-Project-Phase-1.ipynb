    "0. Country: The name of the country being observed.\n",
    "1. Region: The region of the world that the country is in, like Asia-Pacific, North America, Africa, etc.\n",
    "2. SDGi: The SDG Index is a measure of progress of all UN member states on the Sustainable Development Goals.\n",
    "3. Life Exectancy *\\(sic\\)*: The number of years a person can expect to live. (Esteban Ortiz-Ospina, 2017)\n",
    "4. HDI: The United Nations' Human Development Index is an approximate measure of economic and social development based on three dimensions: health, education, and standard of living. Health is measured by life expectancy at birth, education is measured by mean of years of schooling, and standard of living is measured by gross national income per capita. Each country is then given a value from 0 to 1. An HDI of > 0.7 is considered \"high human development\". (United Nations Development Programme, 2023)\n",
    "5. Per Capita GDP: Measured as the GDP (gross domestic product) of a nation divided by its population. It is used to measure the prosperity of a nation. (Investopedia, 2024)\n",
    "6. Income Group: The World Bank Group (2023) assigns countries around the world to one of four income groups: low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high. This is represented in the dataset as LI (low), LM (lower-middle), UM (upper-middle), and HI (high).\n",
    "7. Population (millions): All people inhabiting a country, shown in millions in the dataset. (Merriam-Webster, 2024)\n",
    "8. Cropland Footprint: The ecological footprint (defined below) used to produce food and fiber for human consumption and feed for livestock and other uses. All footprint is measured in global hectares per person. (York University Ecological Footprint Initiative & Global Footprint Network, 2023)\n",
    "9. Grazing Footprint: \n",
    "10. Forest Product Footprint: \n",
    "11. Carbon Footprint: \n",
    "12. Fish Footprint: \n",
    "13. Built up land: \n",
    "14. Total Ecological Footprint (Consumption): A measure of productive land and water area that a population requires to produce all the resources it consumes and to absorb the waste that it generates. This is measured in **global hectares per person**, which is defined as a biologically productive hectare with world average productivity. (York University Ecological Footprint Initiative & Global Footprint Network, 2023)\n",
    "15. Cropland: The biocapacity (defined below) of land used to produce food and fiber for human consumption and feed. (York University Ecological Footprint Initiative & Global Footprint Network, 2023)\n",
    "16. Grazing land: \n",
    "17. Forest land: \n",
    "18. Fishing ground: \n",
    "19. Built up land.1: \n",
    "20. Total biocapacity: The capacity of biologically productive areas to provide for human demand (footprints). It is also measured in global hectares per person. (York University Ecological Footprint Initiative & Global Footprint Network, 2023)\n",
    "21. Ecological (Deficit) or Reserve: This variable measures a country's ecological footprint relative to its biocapacity. If the country's ecological footprint exceeds its biocapacity, there is an ecological deficit. If the country's biocapacity exceeds its ecological footprint, there is an ecological reserve. Like biocapacity and ecological footprint, this is measured in global hectares per person. (York University Ecological Footprint Initiative & Global Footprint Network, 2023)\n",
    "22. Number of Earths required: The number of planet Earths required for everyone in the world to sustain the resources needed to live the average lifestyle of a person in the observed country. (York University Ecological Footprint Initiative & Global Footprint Network, 2023)\n",
    "23. Number of Countries required: Represents how many times the observed country's total biocapacity is needed to provide for its consumption footprint. (York University Ecological Footprint Initiative & Global Footprint Network, 2023)"
